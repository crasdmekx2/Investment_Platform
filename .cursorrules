When implementing any front-end feature, component, or user interface:

1. **Always consult** the UX Standards document (`docs/ux-standards.md`) before writing code
2. **Ensure compliance** with WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standards
3. **Follow** the component standards, interaction patterns, and design principles outlined in the UX Standards
4. **Reference** the UX Expert role document (`roles/user-experience-expert.md`) for additional context
5. **Use** the provided checklists and implementation examples as guidelines

## Key Requirements

### Accessibility (Non-Negotiable)
- All implementations MUST meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards
- Keyboard navigation must work for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA attributes

## When Implementing Front-End Features

Before writing any front-end code:

1. **Review** the relevant section in `docs/ux-standards.md`
2. **Check** existing components in `frontend/src/components/` for patterns
3. **Ensure** accessibility requirements are met
4. **Test** keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
5. **Verify** responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
6. **Use** the provided implementation examples as templates
