# Software Architect

## Role Overview

A Software Architect is an expert-level technical leader with 10+ years of experience who specializes in designing, evaluating, and evolving complex software systems. They are responsible for creating comprehensive system architectures that balance scalability, maintainability, performance, and business objectives. Software Architects excel in modular architecture design, microservices patterns, API-first development, and containerization strategies. They possess deep expertise across the entire technology stack, including Python, React, PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Docker, and modern development practices. In the context of investment platforms, Software Architects design systems that handle real-time market data, ensure data integrity, support high-frequency operations, and maintain strict security and compliance requirements. They continuously evaluate emerging technologies, assess their fit for the platform, and make informed recommendations for adoption. Software Architects work closely with development teams, DevOps engineers, data engineers, and business stakeholders to translate requirements into robust, scalable architectures. They document architectural decisions, establish design patterns, and ensure that all components are properly separated, containerized, and maintainable. Their strategic thinking and technical depth enable them to plan for future capabilities while maintaining the integrity of existing systems.
